    <!--So these two lines are structured so that they are indented to the same place and it makes it look so much neater than before. Now, aside from having just rows and cells, tables also have headers, body and footer mirroring what we have for our HTML websites.
And you can declare them quite simply by writing thead for table head, and tbody for table body, and tfoot for table footer. Now inside the table head, we can add some titles to each of our columns and they get formatted by default in bold. So if we create a new table row and inside this row instead of creating table data or td elements, we're going to create th elements or a table header cell element.
And inside here, we're going to give the name of our first column which is going to be Dates. And then we're going to create another table header cell and this one is going to be the work that we did.
So let's hit save and hit refresh.
And you'll see that we now have table headings for each of our columns.
Now, for those of you guys who might've been playing around with this code, you would have realized that if I cut this table row and instead of putting it inside the header,
<thead>
  <th> Years</th>
  <th>Company</th>
</thead>
<tbody>

</tbody>
<tfoot>

</tfoot>
  <tr>
I actually put it just inside the main table and I delete all of this and we hit save and we hit refresh, you'll notice that it looks exactly the same and that's because we're using these special elements the table header cell elements and most browsers know how these should be formatted. So it looks exactly the same. But the reason why we might have different sections of our table, for example, putting these cells inside the table head and putting these inside the body is because sometimes we might want to select and isolate the table header and the table body in order to style it differently or make it function in a different way. For example, if we separated the table header from the table body, we can use some code to isolate the header and fix it in place so that when users scroll through our table, we can keep these headings on the screen.
Now that requires a little bit more fancy stuff like CSS or JavaScript,-->
